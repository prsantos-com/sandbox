# README

This is the sandbox that we'll play in. :smiley:

I'll play around with git stuff here, so you won't see anything extraordinary. Prepare to be underwhelmed.

I've created more than a couple of branches that I can play around with. If you send me a pull request I might even respond to it for fun. Not sure though. People say things before they actually happen. Once they happen, it's a totally different ball game. In short, I'm making no promises.
